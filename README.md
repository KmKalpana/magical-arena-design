## Overview

In this magical arena, players are defined by the following attributes:
- **Health:** Represents the player's health points. If health reaches 0, the player dies.
- **Strength:** Determines how well the player defends against attacks.
- **Attack:** Determines the damage inflicted on opponents during attacks.

Players take turns attacking each other using dice rolls to determine attack and defense outcomes. The game continues until one player's health drops to 0 or below.
